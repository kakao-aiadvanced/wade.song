However, the primary reason why the sky typically appears blue to our eyes is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\nRayleigh scattering is named after Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. It's a process where shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths by the tiny molecules of gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, that make up the Earth's atmosphere.\\n\\nHere's what happens:\\n\\n1. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these tiny gas molecules.\\n2. The smaller molecules scatter the shorter blue wavelengths of light in all directions, making them visible to our eyes from every angle.\\n3. The longer red wavelengths of light, on the other hand, are not scattered as much because they interact less with the small molecules.\\n\\nAs a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the sky, giving it its characteristic blue color. This scattering effect is most pronounced during the daytime when the sun is overhead and the atmosphere is filled with more gas molecules.\\n\\nOther factors can also influence the apparent color of the sky:\\n\\n* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light in different ways, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\\n* Time of day: The angle of the sun and the position of the observer can change the perceived color of the sky. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on a reddish hue due to the scattering of longer wavelengths.\\n* Atmospheric particles: Aerosols, like dust, smoke, or pollution, can absorb or scatter light in various ways, altering its apparent color.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the main reason why the sky is blue is due to Rayleigh scattering, where shorter wavelengths of light (blue) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red) by tiny gas molecules in the atmosphere.\"},\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":7823156583,\"load_duration\":31693916,\"prompt_eval_count\":16,\"prompt_eval_duration\":178657000,\"eval_count\":399,\"eval_duration\":7610951000}"

      "\n",
      "1. **Select a Sentiment Analysis Model:**\n",
      "   Choose a sentiment analysis model that suits your needs. Popular options include:\n",
      "   - Pre-trained models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT.\n",
      "   - APIs like Google Cloud Natural Language API or Microsoft Azure Text Analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Prepare Test Reviews:**\n",
      "   Create a dataset of test reviews, each labeled with the correct sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral). Here's an example of how you might format this dataset:\n",
      "\n",
      "   | Review Text                                           | Actual Sentiment |\n",
      "   |------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n",

      "   | \"It's okay, nothing special.\"                         | Neutral           |\n",
      "   | \"Absolutely fantastic experience!\"                    | Positive          |\n",
      "   | \"I am not satisfied with my recent purchase.\"        | Negative          |\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Classify Sentiment:**\n",
      "   Use the selected model to classify each review's sentiment. Store the model's predictions for comparison against the actual labels.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Calculate Metrics:**\n",
      "   Once you have the predicted sentiments, calculate accuracy, precision, and recall for each variation. \n",
      "\n",
      "   - **Accuracy**: The proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined. \n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}\n",
      "     \\]\n",
      "   - **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.\n",
      "     \\[\n",
      "     \\text{Precision} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}\n",
      "     \\]\n",

      "     \\]\n",

      "   Where:\n",
      "   - TP = True Positives (correctly identified positives)\n",
      "   - TN = True Negatives (correctly identified negatives)\n",
      "   - FP = False Positives (incorrectly identified as positives)\n",
      "   - FN = False Negatives (incorrectly identified as negatives)\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Evaluate Each Variation:**\n",
      "   Repeat the process for each of your prompt variations using the same test reviews. You may notice different performance metrics based on how the prompts were structured since certain phrasing can lead to variance in model interpretation.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Analyze Results:**\n",
      "   After gathering metrics for each prompt variation, you can compare them to determine which variations provide higher accuracy, precision, and recall. This can help you refine prompt techniques for better sentiment analysis.\n",

      "  \n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Contextual Setup:**\n",

      "\n",
      "3. **Additional Improvements:**\n",
      "   - Include concrete examples and provide hints on the sentiment framework (positive, negative, neutral), making it easier for the model to identify nuances.\n",
      "   - Frame prompts in a way that invites the model to elaborate on its reasoning behind sentiment classification, thereby capturing subtleties that may be missed with a more direct approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Re-evaluation after Adjustments:\n",
      "\n",
      "It would be beneficial to re-run the adjusted prompts through the sentiment analysis model and assess if there is an improvement in accuracy, precision, and recall. This approach can help enhance the effectiveness of less successful prompts while maintaining the strengths of the most effective ones.\n"
