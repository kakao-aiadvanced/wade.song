However, the primary reason why the sky typically appears blue to our eyes is due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering.\\n\\nRayleigh scattering is named after Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the late 19th century. It's a process where shorter (blue) wavelengths of light are scattered more than longer (red) wavelengths by the tiny molecules of gases, such as nitrogen and oxygen, that make up the Earth's atmosphere.\\n\\nHere's what happens:\\n\\n1. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters these tiny gas molecules.\\n2. The smaller molecules scatter the shorter blue wavelengths of light in all directions, making them visible to our eyes from every angle.\\n3. The longer red wavelengths of light, on the other hand, are not scattered as much because they interact less with the small molecules.\\n\\nAs a result, the blue light is distributed throughout the sky, giving it its characteristic blue color. This scattering effect is most pronounced during the daytime when the sun is overhead and the atmosphere is filled with more gas molecules.\\n\\nOther factors can also influence the apparent color of the sky:\\n\\n* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light in different ways, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\\n* Time of day: The angle of the sun and the position of the observer can change the perceived color of the sky. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on a reddish hue due to the scattering of longer wavelengths.\\n* Atmospheric particles: Aerosols, like dust, smoke, or pollution, can absorb or scatter light in various ways, altering its apparent color.\\n\\nSo, to summarize, the main reason why the sky is blue is due to Rayleigh scattering, where shorter wavelengths of light (blue) are scattered more than longer wavelengths (red) by tiny gas molecules in the atmosphere.\"},\"done_reason\":\"stop\",\"done\":true,\"total_duration\":7823156583,\"load_duration\":31693916,\"prompt_eval_count\":16,\"prompt_eval_duration\":178657000,\"eval_count\":399,\"eval_duration\":7610951000}"
